# KAVE_Suite
Python program and GUI that implements cryptography and steganography of text into a .png (!!) image file. Also, the user can decompose the encrypted text from an image and decipher it to see the plain text. Every text cryptographic action, produces a unique key, so that the text can't be read without its unique key.
