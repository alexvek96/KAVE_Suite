Curly, a good-natured Newfoundland, and he were led away by the little
weazened man. That was the last he saw of the man in the red sweater,
and as Curly and he looked at receding Seattle from the deck of the
Narwhal, it was the last he saw of the warm Southland. Curly and he
were taken below by Perrault and turned over to a black-faced giant
called François. Perrault was a French-Canadian, and swarthy; but
François was a French-Canadian half-breed, and twice as swarthy. They
were a new kind of men to Buck (of which he was destined to see many
more), and while he developed no affection for them, he none the less
grew honestly to respect them. He speedily learned that Perrault and
François were fair men, calm and impartial in administering justice, and
too wise in the way of dogs to be fooled by dogs.

François were fair men, calm and impartial in administering justice, and
too wise in the way of dogs to be fooled by dogs. 
Buck saw money pass between them, and was not surprised when
Curly, a good-natured Newfoundland, and he were led away by the little
weazened man. That was the last he saw of the man in the red sweater,
and as Curly and he looked at receding Seattle from the deck of the
Narwhal, it was the last he saw of the warm Southland. Curly and he
were taken below by Perrault and turned over to a black-faced giant
called François. Perrault was a French-Canadian, and swarthy; but
François was a French-Canadian half-breed, and twice as swarthy. They
were a new kind of men to Buck (of which he was destined to see many
more), and while he developed no affection for them, he none the less
grew honestly to respect them. He speedily learned that Perrault and
